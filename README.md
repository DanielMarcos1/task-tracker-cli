# Task Tracker CLI

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application for managing tasks. The project is built using TypeScript and Node.js.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- List all tasks
- Remove tasks by index
- Interactive menu-driven interface

## How it works

The application uses a `TaskManager` class to handle task operations. The main program in `index.ts` provides a user interface through the command line, allowing users to interact with the task list.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   
   npm install
   

2. Build the project:
   
   npm run build
   

3. Run the application:
   
   npm start
   

For development, you can use:

npm run dev


This will start the Task Tracker CLI. Follow the on-screen prompts to manage your tasks.
